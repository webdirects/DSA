<b>Problem</b>

An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the
differences between consecutive integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3],
and [9, 7, 5, 3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are
not arithmetic arrays.

Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is
Ai
. She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has
the maximum length. Please help her to determine the length of the longest
contiguous arithmetic subarray.


<b>Input</b>

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.
Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line
contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai
.

<b>Output</b>

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case
number (starting from 1) and y is the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic
subarray.
